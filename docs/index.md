# Introduction

### Redefining Ethereum Rollup Security

Welcome to the **Native Rollups** website, an open source initiative advancing a new approach where rollups are native to the Ethereum protocol, streamlining execution, fostering seamless integration between Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions and unlocking full Ethereum L1 security.

## What Are Native Rollups?

Native rollups introduce a reimagined execution model by decoupling Ethereum’s traditional EVM state transition function. Instead, execution occurs through a dedicated L1 precompile optimized for interacting with L2 rollups. This design offers:

- **EVM Equivalence:** Full compatibility with future EVM upgrades via Ethereum hard forks.

- **Simplified Infrastructure:** Eliminates the need for fraud proof games, SNARK circuits, and external security mechanisms.

- **L1 Security by Design:** Rollups inherit Ethereum’s native consensus and cryptographic guarantees, ensuring trust-minimized execution and settlement.


## This Website's Mission
