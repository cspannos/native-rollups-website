# Introduction

### Redefining Ethereum Scalability

Welcome to the **Native Rollups** website—a community-driven, open source initiative focused on innovating Ethereum’s scalability and efficiency. We’re dedicated to advancing a new approach where rollups are native to the protocol, streamlining execution and fostering seamless integration between Layer 1 and Layer 2 solutions.

## What Are Native Rollups?

Native rollups propose a reimagined execution model by decoupling the traditional EVM state transition function. This allows for a dedicated pre-compile on L1 that optimizes interactions with various L2 rollups, promising:

- **Increased Efficiency:** Enhanced throughput and lower latency for transactions.  

- **Composability:** Simplified integration across different L2 environments.  

- **Modularity:** A flexible framework that supports continuous innovation and scalability.  

- **Security:** Inherited security and consensus mechanisms of Layer 1, ensuring that all rollup operations benefit from the L1 cryptographic guarantees and trust model.  

## Our Mission

We aim to:

- **Educate:** Provide clear, technical documentation and a comprehensive FAQ to help engineers and researchers navigate the nuances of native rollups.  

- **Collaborate:** Serve as a platform for sharing native rollup research, meeting notes, and hosting discussions that drive the evolution of Ethereum’s scaling solutions.  

- **Innovate:** Foster an open environment where new ideas and approaches can be developed, tested, and implemented collaboratively.
